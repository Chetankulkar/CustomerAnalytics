Project 1 in customer analytics involved the statistical modeling of candy purchases, employing various regression models such as Poisson, Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD), Zero Inflated NBD, and Finite Mixture models. The project aimed to predict customer behavior regarding candy purchases based on different statistical distributions, providing insights into the factors influencing purchasing patterns.

Project 2 extended the analysis to a different context, focusing on customer analytics in the field of article publications. The project included Poisson and NBD regression models to estimate parameters related to the number of articles published, considering additional factors influencing publication behavior. Additionally, it introduced a novel approach, the Zero Inflated NBD Regression, to handle zero-inflated datasets where zeros may arise from two distinct sources.

In both projects, the emphasis was on applying statistical models, particularly maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), to understand and predict customer behavior. The projects aimed to uncover insights that could be valuable for managerial decision-making in areas such as marketing and content publication strategy.
